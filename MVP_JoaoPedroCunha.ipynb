The objective is to explore how particle interactions influence individual drag forces at a steady state.\n","\n","PR-DNS offers highly accurate solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations at a microscale level, although it demands significant computational resources. Key assumptions include treating the fluid as incompressible, isothermal, and Newtonian, along with applying triple periodic boundary conditions. Cylinder particles are created using Discrete Element Methods (DEM) by the legacy solver Grains3D, which randomly determines the centers and angular orientations of cylindrical particles.\n","\n","The data for this study is derived from my ongoing PhD research at the University of British Columbia. Each simulation ran on the supercomputer Niagara, provided by the Digital Research Alliance of Canada, utilizing 320 cores for 48 hours. The primary constraint of this research is the limited ability to generate new data. The current dataset is used to train a fully connected artificial neural network to predict unseen data.\n","\n","The simulation parameters include Reynolds number, solid volume fraction, and aspect ratio of the cylinder particles, which respectively quantify the ratio of inertial to viscous forces, the solid particles' volume to the total domain volume, and the cylinder's length to its diameter. Configurations were tested at Reynolds numbers of 5, 10, 20, and 40; solid volume fractions of 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3; and aspect ratios of 1, 2, and 4, resulting in 36 different flow scenarios. To mitigate bias, each scenario was simulated three times with different random particle configurations.\n","\n","The dataset contains 41,256 cylinders from 108 simulations. Each dataset entry includes the cylinder’s aspect ratio, Reynolds number, and solid volume fraction, followed by 9 scalars representing the particle's rotation matrix, which defines its angular position in space. Subsequent columns provide the positions (x, y, z) relative to the four nearest neighboring particles, adding 12 scalars per row. Additionally, 36 scalars represent the relative rotation matrices for these neighbors, culminating in 60 input parameters per row. The final column indicates the non-dimensional drag force on each particle. A fully connected artificial neural network performs regression analysis to predict the drag force on individual particles."],"metadata":{"id":"YZzcixQFe5I8"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Importing required
